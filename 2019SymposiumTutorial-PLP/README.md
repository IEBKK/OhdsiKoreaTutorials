# Tutorial-PLP (PatientLevelPrediction)
=======================================
Materials for the patient-level prediction tutorial in 2019 OHDSI KOREA Symposium. This workshop is for researchers who want to design and execute clinical prediction models using OHDSI tools. These models predict a diagnostic or prognostic outcome based on a combination of patient characteristics, e.g. demographic information, disease history, and treatment history using machine learning.

## Course Prerequisites

- Thorough understanding of the **OMOP Common Data Model (CDM)** - See the [CDM chapter](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/CommonDataModel.html).
- Thorough understanding of the **OMOP Standardized Vocabularies** - See the [Standardized Vocabularies chapter](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/StandardizedVocabularies.html).
- Thorough understanding of **how to define cohorts using OHDSI's ATLAS** - See the [Defining Cohorts chapter](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/Cohorts.html)
- [Recommended] Ability to program in **R** - There are many R courses available, for example the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming).

## Recommended Reading

- The [Book of OHDSI](http://book.ohdsi.org) in general.
- The [Patient-Level Prediction chapter](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/PatientLevelPrediction.html) and [Method Validity chapter](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/MethodValidity.html) specifically.
